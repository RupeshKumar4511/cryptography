* Encryption : It is  a process of converting plain data into unreadable or coded form. It helps us to avoid any unauthorized access to data.

* Decryption : It is a method of converting the unreadable/coded data into its original form. 



* Cryptography : It is the study of cipher text from plain text. It is used to secure and protect data during communication .

* Encryption and Decryption are two functionalities of  cryptography.

** Types of Cryptography **: 

There are mainly three types of cryptography .

1.) Symmetric Key Cryptography : This system is also called Private Key / Secret Key Cryptography.

Example = AES key Algorithm

2.) Asymmetric Key cryptography : It is more secure approach than symmetric Key cryptography.

In this we use two keys (Public Key and Private Key).

Public Key : known to everyone.

Private Key : which is only Known to user(sender / Receiver ).

Example = RSA  Algorithm, Elliptic curve.

3.) Hashing function : There is no usage of any key in this algorithm. A hash value with fixed length is calculated as per the plain text which makes it impossible for 

contents of plain text to be recovered. Many operating systems use hash functions to encrypt passwords.
Example = SHA 256.

* Shor's Algorithm : This is a quantum algorithm for finding the prime factors of an intreger.
* Grovers's Algorithm :This is a quantum algorithm that solves the unstructured problems.
* Double Ratchet Algorithm : this is a key management algorithm developed in 2013.
